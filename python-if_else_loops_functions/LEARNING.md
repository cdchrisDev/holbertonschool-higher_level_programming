# Learning Objectives
* Why indentation is so important in Python
    * make your code readable and easy to understand
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
    * `if statement == value: return False`
* How to use comments
    * Num sign `#` or triple quote `""", '''` around
* How to affect values to variables
    * equal sign symbol `=`
* How to use the while and for loops
    * While:```While condition is True: exec # until met condition```
    * For: ```for i in list: exec``` *# i is a variable to asign the element which is the current sequence on the loop*
* How to use the break and continues statements
```
for i in list:
    if e + 2 == i:
        continue # if condition is met then keep looping, and do nothing more
    else
        E = i + e 
        break # if condition is not met do some operation, and then stop the loop entirely
```
* What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
    * used as a placeholder for future code
* How to use range
    * `for i in range(0, 2, 10) #init value, step, last value`
* What is a function and how do you use functions
    * a function is a set of instruction to perform some action
* What does return a function that does not use any return statement
    * Return `None`
* Scope of variables
    * Local and global, global can be accessed anywhere while loca can only be accessed in their block range
* Whatâ€™s a traceback
    * A traceback is a report containing the function calls made in your code at a specific point
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
    * `+, /, -, **, ^` the can be used to do math
