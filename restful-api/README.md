# This is restful api Python Module
## Introduction
The Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication system. This approach allows for the easy integration of web services, making them accessible to a wide range of applications.
## Learning Objectives
1. **HTTP/HTTPS Basic**: Understanding principles of the web's primary protocol, how data transfer occurs and the differences between both
2. **API Consumption with Command Line**: Hands-On experience in interacting with API's using command-line tools
3. **API Consumption with Python**: Implement different data fetching techniques for more advance proccessing and data manipulation
4. **API Development with `http.server`**: Understand the basics of crafting and API from scratch using Python's built-in modules.
5. **API Development with Flask Framework**: Focusing on routing, data management and scalability. `Flask` is meant to make something robust, professional and stable no matter how big can be.
6. **API Security & Authentication**: Address the crusial aspects of security, knowing how to protect data transactions and ensure only authorized access to resources
7. **API Standards & Documentation with OpenAPI**: standardized documentation is important to delivery API usage, understand and mantain the projects.
